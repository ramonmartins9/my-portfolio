			stanza: ` The seventh art, I don't know where the passion for cinema came from, 
			I remember starting to watch cinema according to Tiago Belloti and starting to see films in other ways, trying to unravel the filmmakers' minds and trying to understand what he wanted me to do. say in each scene.

			My favorite movie is Spider-Man on Spider's Verse, it's a complete movie, it has everything I like in a movie and whenever I review it I feel the emotions and few movies can do that to me, I hardly ever repeat a movie and this movie challenges me to watch it several times.
			
			My favorite filmmaker is Jordan Peele, he's really good, a mix of horror and comedy is a delight, the way he transitions between these two genres is brilliant.
			I also really like Sam Levinson, especially what he did in Euphoria, you might be wondering "I expected him to name people like Tarantino, Stanley Kubrick, Hitchcock, Scorsese, Coppola, Hayao Miyazaki and etc..."
			I didn't mention any of these directors because they are not promises, they are already consolidated, we all know they are very good. 
			Sam and Peele, are inexperienced and new to the market but they are great promises and in their existing debut works that even though they are new they have a unique vision for cinema and all they needed was just an opportunity to show their works.`,

			stanza: `I play football since I was a kid, it was one of my greatest joys in childhood and part of my adolescence, I played as a forward and if you don't know what a forward is, I'll try to explain.

			He is normally a person in charge of scoring, the whole team battles during the match to defend, to gain space on the field and with that cause a rare opportunity for the center forward to try to score, and what the center forward does in that medium time ? Wait ...
			
			The art of waiting, the fans of my team just hated me, because I didn't show the race to score, I didn't feel so well,
			I just knew how to wait, wait for the perfect opportunity to score, they impatiently didn't understand my strategy and always demanded throughout the match and I kept cool, waiting for the opportunity so as not to waste all the effort my team made for me to activate it, 
			when the opportunity came I was prepared to score, I already knew everything I needed, how the defenders moved, the flaws in the defense line and the bad side of the goalkeeper, that made it easy, 
			we just had to score and go out to celebrate, we didn't always win, but everyone did their part contributing together in a single goal, to win. We win and lose, but always together, that's what matters in this game!`,

			Já paguei algumas promessas (não sou religioso, sou Bahia) e já vi mais derrotas que triunfos e isso me moldou de uma forma que, faço como canta Emicida em pequenas alegrias da vida adulta, minha maior alegria e por isso eu sou, Bahia? Não sei... Rimou, né?`,
